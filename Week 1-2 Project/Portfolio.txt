I finally built my first hero section for my portfolio website in my web development bootcamp at Digital Pathshala.
It might seem small, but it feels like a big step for me. 😄


This small win means a lot — it’s the beginning of turning ideas into something real and visible. Grateful for the guidance, support, and continuous motivation from the Digital Pathshala team.

Excited to keep learning, improving, and building one section at a time. 🌱💻

I'm super happy to share that I’ve officially finished building my complete portfolio website as part of my web development bootcamp at Digital Pathshala.

This project really pushed me to learn, experiment, and bring all the pieces together — and seeing it finally come to life feels amazing! 😄💻

Grateful for the guidance and support throughout the journey.
One project down… many more to go! 🚀
