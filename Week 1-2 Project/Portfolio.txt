I finally built my first hero section for my portfolio website in my web development bootcamp at Digital Pathshala.
It might seem small, but it feels like a big step for me. 😄


This small win means a lot — it’s the beginning of turning ideas into something real and visible. Grateful for the guidance, support, and continuous motivation from the Digital Pathshala team.

Excited to keep learning, improving, and building one section at a time. 🌱💻
